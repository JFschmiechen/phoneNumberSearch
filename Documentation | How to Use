Requirements:

  - Google voice account
  
  - Gmail account
  
  - Phone with service
  
  - Computer to host program while you are away
  
  - Foreverjs (https://github.com/foreverjs/forever)
  
  Getting Started:
  
    Download this repository and dependencies on the computer you wish to act as a server. Then fill in the labeled sections in the 
    program with the corresponding information. E.g. 'GMAIL' would be your gmail email. Afterwards use Foreverjs to allow the program
    to restart once a request has been made and finished. Now you always have access to phone numbers as long as you have a cellular 
    signal.
